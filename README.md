**This was a quick demo of what you can do with [d3-state-visualizer](https://github.com/romseguy/d3-state-visualizer). It's recommended to use [redux-chart-monitor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-chart-monitor) to get the benefits of using [redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) in your Redux project.**

# Quick TodoMVC demo

# Features

- Fully configurable
- Collapsible nodes
- Hot reloadable since it's only a component that receive any state as props
- Redux and React are not hard dependencies, I used my favorite tools for this demo but you can use your own stack

# Try it out yourself!

```
git clone https://github.com/romseguy/redux-store-visualizer.git
cd redux-store-visualizer
npm install
npm start
# http://localhost:3000
```

# Standalone implementation (without redux-devtools)
